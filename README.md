## Context 
The website is based on like makeup companies using candy themed for their new line of products. The client is someone who is maybe an influencer wanting to customize their page in their page from the company they got sponsored. 

The goal of the website is showcase just the themes of the new line of products. 


## Things to Improve
I wanted to include more makeup-like pictures but most of the pictures I found don't fit the theme so I opted it. 

I tried doing a different approach in organizing my css files and I think that there are things overlapping or I didn't do it right. 

I would try to do a hamburger menu next time so I could improve my skills.
